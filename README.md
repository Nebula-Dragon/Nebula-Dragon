Hi, I'm Alex Elliott, aka Nebula Dragon. I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Leeds.
This GitHub repository serves as my portfolio for various personal projects, old and new. At least until I get a website.

My university work can be found at https://gitlab.com/AlexElliott.

As well as what can be found here, I also contributed to this game dev project: https://github.com/0rang/story_jam. For some reason GitHub has forgotten that I contributed at all, so my name can still be seen in the commits but does not link to this profile, and indeed cannot be clicked on at all. I have no idea why.
